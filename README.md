## About Me

Hello World! My name is Mateo Wallace and I am ecstatic that you have found my page. Code and design have been a dream of mine for many years and I'm just beginning on my journey to become a Full Stack Web Developer.
My dream is to one day travel to every single National State Park on one giant roadtrip. My endeavors in programming hopefully will push me towards that goal.

My greatest hobbies are also my aspirations. Foremost among them are to work in a field surrounding nerd culture. Whether that be Tabletop Board Games, Video Games, or Anime.

I can't wait to colllaborate with you in the future and wish you a good time exploring my page!

<!-- Kudos for finding this note!
As a reward for finding it, heres a fun fact!
The first D&D campaign I ever ran was called Dawn's Ascension-->
